I am Hamza, the developer of CATCHAT.\n

My interest to develop CATCHAT arised in the early days of March 2022.\n

It wasn't easy at all, infact I should mention it was extremely hard as I had no help to get to this stage and moreover I had no support while developing this app. The best part was I was too dedicated and determined to develop this application that even people demotivating me couldn't stop me from my work.\n

I still managed it somehow and developed something kinda useful.\n

The amount of energy and time spent on this was the most in all the types of projects I have made.\n

I literally can't make credits / cast of this application as I will just have to copy paste my own name again and again ðŸ˜‚.\n

I feel like there is only one developer on EARTH and that's me cause I tried searching but found none except ETERNAL DARKNESS.\n

IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WAS TO RESOLVE ERRORS ðŸ˜”\n

I am looking for people who can give me proper feedback and provide me support ( for first time in my life ) to help me take this application to ADVANCED level.\n

PLEASE TRY GIVING 5 STAR RATING\n
Now this is the biggest obstacle for me to overcome.\n
That is to make my $user HAPPY.\n

ALL THE BEST ðŸ™‚\n
ENJOY AND PROVIDE ME FEEDBACK\n
WISH YOU A HAPPY CATCHAT LIFE\n"
